# Hierarchy
A Windows Application That Allows You to Create and Visualize Tree View Models

This application allows you to 

* View models in a TreeView 
* Manually Create your models
* Save your model to an XML file
* Load your model from an XML file
* 

## Why did I create this

I work maintaining legacy code.  My job entails making changes, enhancements and bug fixes to a project that is over 10 years old.  The project is pretty complex and many times I have to reverse engineer the project via the source code.  Many times I use UML diagrams to help with this effort.  Other times I simply need to know the Hierarchical relationship for the sub-system.

Since I couldn't find an application that already does this I decided to create one.  For example, let's say I have a asset management subsystem. This management sub-system allows you to assign inventory to asset holders, add asset holders, re-assign assets from one asset holder to another.  I would like to know the relationship of all the html files (JSP), Java, Data Access Files, Configuration Files, menu files, component files, control files, bean files, etc.  I would like to see them in a hierarchical structure.  This applicaiton is ideal for that.  This way I can refer to it as I need to when I'm trying to understand the big picture and sometimes even drill down into the details. This application won't gather the relationships automatically. I still have to that part manually but at least I have a good way to record those relation ships.

## What other uses

You can really use the application for whatever want brackets, family trees, whatever structure requires an easy way to create and maintain a hierachical structure.


Enjoy.
